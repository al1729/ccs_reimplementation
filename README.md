# ccs_reimplementation
A reimplementation of the ICLR 2023 paper ["Discovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827), by Burns et al.
We specifically implement the case where GPT-J is used to predict sentiment polarity on an Amazon reviews dataset.
Embeddings can be generated by running ```load_data.py``` and the Contrast-Consistent Search model itself can be trained and evaluated via ```ccs.py```.

In the future, I'm planning on using this method on Theory of Mind QA tasks ([example](https://github.com/kayburns/tom-qa-dataset)) to analyze to what extent models can separate truth from agent modeling.
